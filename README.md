# 🎓 CCMS - Campus Complaint Management System

> Report it. Track it. Fix it. 🚀

## 👋 What We're Building

Welcome to the **Campus Complaint Management System (CCMS)**!  

This project will allow students to report campus issues (broken fans, dirty washrooms, flickering lights) and give admins a dashboard to track, assign, and resolve them efficiently.  

**Right now:** We only have the basic folder structure set up — we’ll gradually add code, dependencies, and features together.

## 🌳 Git Workflow (Keep It Simple!)

- **`main`** → Final production-ready code (hands off! 🚫)  
- **`develop`** → Where we test & integrate everything  

### Daily Flow

```bash
# Step 1: Start fresh from develop
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

# Step 2: Create YOUR feature branch
git checkout -b yourname-feature

# Step 3: Work on your feature

# Step 4: Stage, commit, and push
git add .
git commit -m "Add: feature description"
git push origin yourname-feature

# Step 5: Open Pull Request to merge into develop
````

> Flow: `your-branch` → `develop` (via PR) → `main` (only at the end)

## 🚀 Future Plans

* **Dependencies:** Will install with `npm install` in each folder.
* **Ports (planned):**

  * Backend → `http://localhost:5000`
  * Student Frontend → `http://localhost:3000`
  * Admin Panel → `http://localhost:3001`
* **Environment variables:** Will use `.env` files for secrets (JWT, database URL, email, etc.).

> Don’t worry — we’ll add these step by step as we code.

## 🛑 Friendly Rules & Tips

| DO ✅                                | DON'T ❌                                     |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Work on your own branch             | Push directly to `main`                     |
| Pull from `develop` before starting | Start coding without pulling latest changes |
| Commit often with clear messages    | Commit `.env` or `node_modules/`            |
| Ask teammates for help if stuck     | Waste hours struggling alone                |
| Use Pull Requests for review        | Merge your own PR without review            |

## 📚 Documentation (`docs/` folder)

Keep notes and docs as we go:

* `project-overview.md` → Project description & goals
* `api-docs.md` → API endpoints & examples (later)
* `meeting-notes.md` → Team discussions and decisions

> Helps everyone stay on the same page while learning together.

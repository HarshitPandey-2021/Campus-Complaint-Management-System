## 🛡️ Rules (Keep It Clean!)

| ✅ DO | ❌ DON'T |
|-------|----------|
| Create feature branches | Push to `develop` or `main` directly |
| Request PR reviews (min 1 approval) | Merge your own PR without review |
| Write clear commit messages | Use vague messages like "fix" or "update" |
| Pull before starting work | Work on outdated code |
| Test locally before pushing | Push broken code |
| Keep `.env` files local | Commit secrets or `node_modules/` |
